# Liberty University Engineering Enhancement Proposal

This repository contains a formal engineering proposal developed for **ENGR 270 – Technical Communications** at **Liberty University**. The project explores strategic academic and service-oriented enhancements to the School of Engineering, with an emphasis on technical rigor, feasibility, and Christ-centered impact.

## Project Overview

The proposal presents **three independent but complementary initiatives**:

1. **Introduction to Engineered Propulsion** *(Technical Elective Proposal)*  
2. **History of Engineering** *(Elective Course Proposal)*  
3. **LU Serve Community Service Application** *(Software & Community Outreach Proposal)*  

Each proposal was designed to address a real gap in Liberty University’s current academic or service infrastructure while remaining realistic in scope, budget, and implementation timeline.

## My Contribution

I was the **sole author and technical lead for Proposal 1: _Introduction to Engineered Propulsion_**.

My responsibilities included:
- Identifying the curricular gap in propulsion-focused engineering education  
- Designing the full course structure, learning objectives, and assessment methods  
- Conducting and analyzing student interest surveys  
- Developing feasibility, budget, and implementation timelines  
- Aligning the course with Liberty University’s mission and engineering outcomes  

This proposal reflects my academic and professional interests in **propulsion, aerospace systems, and applied engineering education**, and it directly supports my broader portfolio work in propulsion and rocketry.

## Proposal 1 Summary: Introduction to Engineered Propulsion

The proposed course is a **3-credit technical elective** intended for sophomore- and junior-level engineering students. It introduces the fundamentals of propulsion systems through a combination of:

- Thermodynamics and fluid dynamics
- Thrust and performance analysis
- Propulsion system comparison and evaluation
- Hands-on laboratories and simulation tools (MATLAB, ANSYS)
- A team-based capstone propulsion project

The course is designed to prepare students for careers in aerospace, automotive, defense, and energy industries while emphasizing interdisciplinary problem-solving and ethical, Christ-centered engineering practice.
